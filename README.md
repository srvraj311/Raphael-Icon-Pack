Android icon pack that contains fresh handmade icons for your device.

NOTE- This is my new project, It might have fewer icons than usual, But I am working on a daily basis to add new icons.So give me some time.

If you Want to contribute to this project in terms of icons or wallpapers,
Please use the `Default_round.psd` file to start building one @192x192 resolution.
Export it to `@res/drawable_nodpi`
Add  `<item  component="ComponentInfo{ Package/Activity name }"  drawable=" Your Exported Icon Without Extentsion " />`    in `appfilter.xml` located in `@res/xml` and `appfilter.xml` in `/assets` folder.
Then Add  `<item drawable="Your Exported Icon Without Extentsion" />` to `drawable.xml` in both `@res/xml` and `assets/` folder.
